# Messy data

## What is in this Unit?

#### Main topics

- Alternative tabular sources
- Non-tabular data sources
- Common problems and solutions
- Dealing with larger datasets

#### Summary

Here you'll learn how to get data from multiple data sources and how to transform raw data into clean enough data so that you can begin your data science workflow.

This unit is about common problems when handling alternative structured data files such as **csv files** (with specific delimiters or corrupt data) and **non-csv formats** (like excel with multiple sheets or json files).
It also covers handling larger datasets, including using some Jupyter notebooks magics and loading big files using chunks. 

Good luck!
